Master plan for the project


Step-by-step outline of project  
  - Exploring / navigating to each room on trash sweep
  - If going room by room, Decide how to break up area (i.e. pick spots to do 360deg scan from)
  - Navigate to a sweep spot
  - Complete sweep and log potential trash candidates
  - Pick a candidate to asses
  - Navigate to candidate
  - Asses candidate
    * if trash, ask for pickup
  - Go to next candidate
  - If all candidates cleared, move to next assesment spot (repeat)
  - If all assessment spots cleared, go to next area (repeat)
  - If all areas cleared, finish circuit by potentially going to office for emptying trash
